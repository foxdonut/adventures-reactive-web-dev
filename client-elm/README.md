## What is this article about?

I wrote this article out of wondering how to organize code that follows the Elm architecture. I
wanted to divide the code for parts of a page (call them components, sections, blocks, etc., I'll
call them features from here on out) into their own directories. I wanted each feature to be
independent of the others, but find a way for them to communicate information with each other.
Finally, I wanted to see if I could group some of these features together to assemble larger
features, while still keeping the same pattern of inter-feature communication.

I also did not want to reinvent the wheel, so I am not replacing `StartApp`. In fact, each feature
is built with `StartApp` and is itself an `App`. They are assembled together to form the final `App`
that is used in the top-level `Main`.

Some disclaimers: I only recently started learning Elm, and do not claim to be an expert.
Furthermore, I do not claim to have invented any of the ideas presented in this article. The purpose
is simply to put together what I feel are the best parts of what I have learned from
[The Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/),
[Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/model-view-intent.html),
[RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS),
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html), and others.

That being said, my goal is to explain an approach to organize Elm code into _features_, where each
feature is part of a page and is decoupled from other features, and to connect these features with
_behaviours_. Behaviours are "what happens next" during a View -> Action -> Signal -> Update -> View
cycle. Specifically, we want to be able to

- Create features: each feature should be self-contained and independent of other features.
- Chain events: _after this happens, that should happen next_.
- Connect features with signals: _after this happens, notify all other features that want to be notified_,
without needing to "know" what those other features are. Features react to events: _do something
when **this** happens_, without needing to "know" which feature made **this** happen.
- Build a large feature out of smaller features: useful to make a group of features reusable as a
whole, without having to re-create the group each time.

This will hopefully become clear when we dig into it and look at the code. What's important to know
before reading on is that I assume knowledge of The Elm Architecture, because I build on top of that
and will not go over the Elm Architecture itself. Please refer to
[The Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)
and [The Elm Tutorial](http://www.elm-tutorial.org/).

## Example Overview

I will use a simple Todo list application as an example. The application is on a single page, with a
list of todos and a form, allowing for creating, editing, and deleting todos. We'll add a summary at
the bottom which shows the total number of todos and the average priority. Finally, we'll add a
section at the top that shows the highest and lowest priority of the todo list.

The application is backed by a server that accepts requests, using JSON as the data exchange format.
The server is implemented with [Koa](http://koajs.com/). I won't go into the details of the server
implementation since it is not the focus of this article.

## Running the Application

The instructions to run the example application are the same as for all of the other examples, so
please follow the
[top level instructions](https://github.com/foxdonut/adventures-reactive-web-dev/tree/master#requirements).

## Article

The article is divided into four parts, each in a separate branch:

- [Part 1: Creating a Feature](https://github.com/foxdonut/adventures-reactive-web-dev/tree/elm-010-todolist-feature/client-elm#creating-a-feature)
- [Part 2: Connecting Features Together](https://github.com/foxdonut/adventures-reactive-web-dev/tree/elm-020-todoform-feature/client-elm#connecting-features-together)
- [Part 3: Multiple Listeners](https://github.com/foxdonut/adventures-reactive-web-dev/tree/elm-030-todosummary-feature/client-elm#multiple-listeners)
- [Part 4: Composing Features](https://github.com/foxdonut/adventures-reactive-web-dev/tree/elm-040-todominmax-feature/client-elm#composing-features)

The code in master is the same as in Part 4.
